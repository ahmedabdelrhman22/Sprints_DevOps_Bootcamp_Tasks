The definition of done (DoD) :
A definition of done is when all conditions, or acceptance criteria,
that a software product must satisfy are met and ready to be accepted by a user, customer, team, or consuming system.
We must meet the definition of done to ensure quality.
It lowers rework, by preventing user stories that don’t meet the definition from being promoted to higher level environments. 
It will prevent features that don’t meet the definition from being delivered to the customer or user.
DoD Examples:

    1- Unit tests passed
    2- Code reviewed
    3- Acceptance criteria met
    4- Functional tests passed
    5- Non-Functional requirements met
    6- Product Owner accepts the User Story

The definition of ready (DoR) :
A definition of ready (DoR) is used to determine whether work on a task is ready to be started. Before teams assign a task or user story in a sprint, it must be sufficiently well described and understood by team members. 
The development team should grasp enough of a proposed scope to plan it into a sprint, estimate completion time, and allocate adequate resources to meet its goal. 
A definition of ready serves as a checklist of criteria to help facilitate a team's decision to begin working on a new task. Note that a definition of ready is different from a definition of done (DoD).

DoR Examples:

    
    1- The business value is clearly communicated
    2- The team can demo the feature
    3- The story has a short summary
    4- The story can fit into one sprint
    5- There are no external dependencies
